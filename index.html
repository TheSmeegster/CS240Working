        My name is Aidan Thiele, I am a sophomore at the University of Puget Sound. I am majoring in biology and computer science.
        During my free time I like to play games with my friends both on and off the computer. I also enojoy hiking and various outdoor
        activities. I hope to travel more in the future as well.
