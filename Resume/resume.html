    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p class="important">
        I am a sophomore at the University of Puget Sound 
        my planned majors are computer science and biology 
        (or molecular and cellular biology).

    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p class="important">
        I have done a good bit of community service at the Ballard Food Bank
        and some on Crystal Mountain cleaning up the debris from the previous ski
        season. I also worked at Veraci Pizza for some time and have helped 
        teach younger children how to cook for many years at Silvanas Dessert Academy.
        Before assisting at Silvanas I took the class myself so overall I have spent 10 
        or more years going there since the 1st grade, and I thouroughly enjoy it.
    </p>

    <h2>Coursework</h2>
    <p class="important">
        The classes I have taken in CS are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="fancy">
        <li>CS240 Software Engineering</li>
        <li>CS261 Intro to Computer Science 2</li>
        <li>4 years of assorted highschool CS classes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
    <p class="important">
        I am currently working on a game with 2 other friends of mine that we have been
        working on for over a year now, though I am not doing very much of the coding itself.
        I usually have been working on 3D models for the game while one friend does a majority of 
        the code and the other does the music. I also made a small first person shooter on 2 occasions,
        one on my own, and one in a group of myself and 2 others, though they were nonparticipatory 
        for the majority of the coding process. During my previous CS classes in college I have also 
        completed a few projects as well.
    </p>

    <h2>Affiliations</h2>
    <p class="important">
        I am trying to get more involved in the outdoor club and various activities on campus, 
        though it has been difficult to get to know anyone or any clubs that well. I used to play 
        soccer quite often on a select soccer team through Seattle United, and I hope to pick soccer 
        back up as soon as possible with some people.
